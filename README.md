# Welcome to My GitHub

I work for **Awesome Inc**, maintaining their websites and providing coding assistance to startups in their accelerator program. I also work for **Abundant Technologies**, developing **ForeYou**, an anti-budgeting app.

I primarily use **React** for the frontend and **Node or Python** for the backend.

Feel free to check out my projects, and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nwils000).
